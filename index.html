        <p><h2>Rules of the UNO</p></h2>

<p>Dealing
At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt by 7 cards (blindly). The remaining cards are put face down - this is the deck "Widdie". The top card from the deck "Widdie" is turned over, put next to and becomes the first card of the "Discard" deck.</p>

        <li>Game</li>
<li>The game starts "clockwise". The first player is after the dealer (the dealer changes each round, usually clockwise). During his turn, the player has the right to lay one card on the "Discard" deck according to the following rules:</li>
</li>
<p>Or the card should be the same colour.</p>
<p>Or the card must have the same digit, or the same picture (be active), or be a black active card.</p>
<p>In the absence of a suitable card, the player takes one card from the deck "Widdie" (blindly). If the card meets the above conditions - the player can put the card on the deck "Discard", if not satisfied - the player leaves the card himself, says "Pass" and the turn goes to the next player.</p>
<p>The game continues until one of the players discards all the cards. After that, the points by the remaining cards are counted (the value of the cards is shown in the section Types of cards, the winners are determined according to the results of several rounds - clause Win).</p>
<li><h2>Active UNO cards</h2></li>
<div class="left-float">
<img class="active_cards" src="img/uno_cards_miss.gif" width="104" height="160" alt="Skip"/>
</div>

<p>"Skip" - the next player misses his turn.
The player can "save" from the action of this card only by laying out exactly the same card (the same colour, the same picture), that is, by performing the Intervention.
<div class="left-float">
<img class="active_cards" src="img/uno_cards_take2.gif" width="104" height="160" alt="Take two"/>
</div>

<p>"Take two" - the next player takes two cards from the "Widdie" deck (blindly) and skips his turn.
The player can "save" from the action of this card by laying out his card "Take Two" (the colour can be any).
The actions of the cards "Take Two" are not summed up, and the last player, on which the "chain" of laying out the "Take Two" cards, takes only two cards from the "Widdie" deck and skips his turn.

<div class="left-float">
<img class="active_cards" src="img/uno_reverse_card.gif" width="104" height="160" alt="uno reverse card"/>
</div>

"Reverse card" - the direction of the turn is reversed. For example, it was "clockwise", after laying out the uno reverse card it will be "counter-clockwise".
When laying out several cards "Reverse" their actions are summarized. For example, two cards "Reverse" have no effect - the turn continues in the same direction as before, three cards "Reverse" change the direction of the turn to the opposite, etc.
<div class="left-float">
<img class="active_cards" src="img/uno_cards_black.gif" width="104" height="160" alt="Choose Colour"/>
</div>
<p>"Choose Colour" - allows you to change the player's current colour (for any, including the current colour). The next player must put any card of the specified colour. In order to lay out the card "Choose Colour" the player does not need any special conditions, unlike the next card "Choose Colour and take four"...
<div class="left-float">
<img class="active_cards" src="img/uno_cards_black4.gif" width="104" height="160" alt="Choose Colour and take four"/>
</div>

<p>"Choose Colour and take four" - can only be laid out by the player in his turn and only if the player (player-1) lacks the current colour (the current number / active cards / black active card Choose Colour can and to be present is not important, the main thing is the absence of the current colour). Simultaneously with laying out this card you need to choose a colour (can be any, including the current colour). The next player (player-2) takes four cards (blindly) from the "Widdie" deck and skips the turn.
<p>Player-2 can "save" from the action of this card only after laying out the "Take Two" card of the new ordered colour (then everything goes as usual with the standard "Take Two" card action).
<p>Check for honesty. If player-2, whom action of "Choose Colour and take four" is directed, suspects that he is being deceived and player-1, who has laid out this card, actually has the current colour, he can ask to show cards of player-1. If the suspicions are justified, player-1 takes his card "Choose Colour and take four" back into his hand, takes four cards from the deck "Widdie" (blindly), skips the turn (in fact, the card "Choose Colour and take four"). If suspicions were in vain, player-2 takes four cards from the "Widdie" deck, and also two more cards for mistrust and skips the turn.
<p>Rule of politeness. The game continues only after the player sorts out his new four cards and says "Ready."</p>

<li><h2>The rule "UNO!"</h2>
<li>The player must warn that he has one card left and maybe he will finish the game soon. Laying out the penultimate card (while he has not released it yet), the player must have time to say "UNO!" (which means "one" in Italian). If the player does not do this, "good friends" (or one friend) can notice this and remind "UNO!". Friends must have time to do this from the moment the player releases his penultimate card before the next player starts turn (laying out the card or drawing the card from the deck). For forgetfulness, a player who did not say "Uno!" on time takes two cards (blindly) from the "Widdie" deck.

<li>Note. Players do not have the right to hide the number of cards in their hand (that is, collect a stack or hide under the table). Friends should be always known quantity of the card to help a forgetful player.
<li>Fines
<li>With a large number of errors and inattention, an additional rule can be introduced - for any erroneously laid out card, false shout, etc. the player takes two cards from the "Widdie" deck (blindly).</li>
